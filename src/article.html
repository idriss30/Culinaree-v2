        <p>
          The best summer recipes involve minimal prep and little to no cooking,
          which is why this light, refreshing salad is always in my rotation.
          It’s packed with rich and creamy avocado, perfectly ripe cherry
          tomatoes, sliced red onion, and plenty of cilantro, all tossed
          together in a simple lemon vinaigrette. The best part? It only takes
          10 minutes to make, meaning you can get back outside and enjoy the
          sunshine.
        </p>
        <span>5 Ways to Customize This Simple Summer Salad</span>
        <p>
          Whether you’re looking to bulk it up or just use up what’s in your
          fridge, here are five ways to riff on this effortless summer side.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Switch up the citrus. Try using lime juice in place of lemon juice,
            which will give this salad guacamole vibes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Play around with the herbs. Practically any tender herb can be used
            here (think: parsley, basil, mint, or a combination).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add some cheese. Go ahead and crumble in some salty feta or queso
            fresco.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go heavy on the fruit. Peaches or mangoes would be perfect for a bit
            of fun and sweetness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in fresh corn. If you’ve got some corn on the cob left over,
            cut off the kernels and toss them right in.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span>How Long Can Avocado Last in a Salad?</span>
        <p>
          Any salad containing avocado is best eaten the day it’s made, before
          the avocado starts to brown. With that said, this salad can be
          refrigerated in an airtight container for up to three days.

          Preparing for emergencies may not always be at the top of your to-do
          list, but you can start small and avoid stress down the line by
          assembling an emergency stockpile at home. Toilet paper, cleaning
          products and water are some of the obvious essentials, but it can be
          tough to know exactly which foods are safe to store for long periods
          of time. Shop TODAY spoke to food safety experts to find out which
          items we should be reaching for when prepping for emergency
          situations.
        </p>
        <span>Start with the basics</span>
        <p>
          Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health
          at New York University, suggests starting with staples like beans,
          rice, pasta, canned tomato sauce, tuna, crackers and canned vegetables
          and fruits. These goods tend to have expiration dates that do not
          require immediate preparation and can last several months in your
          pantry. Dr. Benjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety extension
          specialist at North Carolina State University, adds that crackers, nut
          butters, granola bars, nuts, jerky, shelf-stable boxes of milk, snack
          puddings and nuts are also safe options to keep on hand. He also
          suggests produce such as oranges, apples and carrots since they won't
          spoil or grow pathogens with proper refrigeration.
        </p>
        <span>Prepare food appropriately and be careful with leftovers</span>
        <p>
          Although canned foods are an effective way to create a diverse pantry
          to last through emergencies, it's important to ensure that that your
          food is properly cooked and handled. Dr. Darin Detwiler, a professor
          of food safety and policy at Northeastern University says proper
          preparation should still be one of your top priorities during an
          emergency. "Cooking is a 'kill step' to eliminate harmful pathogens in
          food," Detwiler said. "Eating soups, chili and vegetables straight out
          of a can without actually cooking it is not the safest option." He
          also advises against cooking too much at once, as leftovers can spoil
          over a long period of time. "Cooking too much and leaving it out of
          the refrigerator too long can — and has — caused many problems. Rice
          is a major suspect as it allows bacteria to grow at a rapid rate if
          not refrigerated quickly and in small containers," Detwiler told
          TODAY.
        </p>
        <span>What to buy ?</span>
        <p>
          To help create your list of emergency pantry staples, we picked a few
          shelf-stable items that can be delivered to your doorstep.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>crackers</strong> are an easy option when it comes to
            snacking. This variety pack is available on Amazon and features two
            different flavors that are packed with protein.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chapman listed<strong> granola bars</strong> and breakfast bars as
            items to keep on hand that can be enjoyed at any time
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nut butters</strong> are high in calories and are also a
            convenient source of protein.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Dry pasta </strong> is easy to store and cook</li>
          <li>
            To keep up your intake of essential vitamins,
            <strong>fruit bowls</strong> make for an easy snack or dessert
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Canned evaporated milk </strong> is a great way to consume
            dairy and a source of vitamin D.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Packets of tuna </strong> are a great source of protein and
            calories. Since they come in pouches, no draining is necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dried rice </strong> is another shelf-stable option that can
            be enjoyed in a matter of minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Soups </strong> are easy to store and usually have a long
            shelf life. However, Detwiler notes that many soups and beans should
            still be properly cooked when possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fruits and vegetables </strong> as a perfect shelf-stable
            item to stock up on.
          </li>
        </ul>
